            <h3>Pumpkin:</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Pumpkins are a type of squash. They are in the gourd family, which means they have a hard skin, or shell,
                <br> and grow on vines. You might think of them as a vegetable, but pumpkins are a fruit because
                 they develop from a <br>flower and hold the seeds of the plant. You may also think pumpkins are only orange, but think again!</p>
